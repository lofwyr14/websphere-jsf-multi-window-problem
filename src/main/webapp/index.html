<h1>websphere-jsf-multi-window-problem</h1>

<h2>Welcome to this test page.</h2>

<p>
  <b>Note: To view this page correctly it must be run inside a JSF 2.0 (or higher) Application Server!</b>
</p>

<p>
  To validate this problem, please load this page after deploying the application and do eventually a
  &lt;SHIFT&gt; + reload.
</p>
<p>
  You should see two i-frames with 2 counters numbers and one reload button per i-frame.
</p>

<iframe width="500" height="300" src="window1.xhtml" frameborder="3"></iframe>

<iframe width="500" height="300" src="window2.xhtml" frameborder="3"></iframe>

<p>
  If a ViewExpiredException occurs, do the &lt;SHIFT&gt; + reload again.
</p>
<p>
  Both counters should be 0, but other number may be okay.
</p>
<p>
  Now click on "reload 1" or "reload 2" some times. Each click will reload the iframe the button is inside.
  You see the counter of the iframe growing and the other one will only updated.
  After some clicks you might be familiar with the simple logic...
</p>
<p>
  Now click on "reload 2", more than 20 times without clicking "reload 1".
</p>
<p>
  If you now using "reload 1" there a two possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    counter 1 will grow again, and counter 2 will be updated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Or, on Webphere WAS 8.5.5.13 an ViewExpiredException occur</b>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This works since MyFaces 2.0.6, because of this parameter:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context-param>
  &lt;param-name>org.apache.myfaces.NUMBER_OF_SEQUENTIAL_VIEWS_IN_SESSION&lt;/param-name>
  &lt;param-value>2&lt;/param-value>
&lt;/context-param>
</code></pre>

<p>
  The basic problem is described in the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-3117">MyFaces Jira</a>
  declared as blocker.
  It was solved over 7 years ago.
</p>

<p>
  WAS 9.0.0.7 has not this problem.
